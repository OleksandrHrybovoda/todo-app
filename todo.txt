Tasks
Every task has such structure:
{
id - number, integer
Title - text
Description - text
Last Update Date - string or date or int 
Creation Date - string or date or int 
}
Any user can create new task, edit any task, delete any task.
On page 'tasks' show list of all tasks like list of cards. Use standard components from Material library.
Don't care about styles much at this point. 
Use pagination, show only 10 tasks per page. When user scrolls down, there is a button saying "Show more". 
Click on that button loads and displays another portion of 10 tasks if available. 
When next portion of tasks is fetched from server - show toast message saying, "N Tasks successfully fetched."
If error - show the same toast but in red with details of error. 
API to fetch tasks and comments will be provided later. Currently use stubs but write code in a good manner so it's 
possible to easily switch to api instead of stubs.
